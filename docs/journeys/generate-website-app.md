   - Open the app to access the main interface.
   - You will see a text area where you can input details.

2. **Enter Details**
   - In the text area, type in the specifics of the website or app you wish to create.

4. **View the Generated Preview**
   - After processing, a preview of the generated website/app will be displayed.
